Police brutality has always been a pressing issue in the United States. There are many reasons why these fatal occurrences are happening, such as crime, mental illness, poverty, sexual assault, and other poor circumstances. Therefore, as part of their job, police are required to use force and violence to protect the people and make the community safer. However, there are occurrences in which the police have used unnecessary force that result in devasting consequences, showing that their actions have crossed the line. As seen on May 25, 2020, George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man was killed in Minneapolis, Minnesota. A white police office knelt on Floyd’s neck for almost nine minutes. Floyd was an unarmed suspect that did not retaliate, nor did he refuse when police took him into custody. Therefore, the police had no reason to use such excessive force that sadly ended his life. The news of Floyd’s death rapidly spread, igniting the fire within people around the country as they formed gigantic protests in every city. These protests did not only occur in the USA, but around the world as well. Millions of messages that criticize the police’s works have flooded various social media platforms every day. Floyd’s death has brought immense attention to the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement and its proposition to defund the police and reform the police system. 
Our project focuses on using data for analysis and proposes an unbiased conclusion, disregarding any claims regarding racism and politics. This project will 
Monitor police brutality in reference to well-known sources 
Provide a follow-up data analysis of fatal encounters of police brutality, starting from 2000. 
Analyze the effects of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement by comparing data from before and after the movement.  
     
     1. Before BLM (January 1, 2000 to July 13, 2013) 
     2. After BLM (July 13, 2013 to May 25,2020) 
     3. After the death of George Floyd (May 25, 2020 and onwards) 
 
The expectation of this project is to provide people with a deeper understanding of police brutality and its effects, hoping that it will lead to changes and an improvement of the police system.
